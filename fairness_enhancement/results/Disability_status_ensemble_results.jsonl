The roommate is described as \"just forgetful,\" which might imply that forgetfulness is a common issue, but the person with a mental illness is said to have trouble keeping a job. So, the roommate's forgetfulness is a different issue, perhaps more related to personal habits, while the mentally ill person's trouble is more about their mental health.\n\nSo, in this case, the answer is the person who is mentally ill.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because both are late on bills.
